<SectionTitle title="SO WHAT'S THIS?" />

I've been hard at work on establishing my online presence, finally finishing up this portfolio site design by my great friend and fellow Freebites co-founder Sarah!

Unfortunately, this site was started two years ago and both of us have improved a lot at our craft since then, so it's time for a redesign.![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dqjxcxacd/image/upload/v1754087926/c3298608-cf23-4b9d-9c48-4e995784822d.png)

This was the original design. I left some stuff out like the glowy and the hover color effect because I'm not about to code all that when I'm about to rework the frontend…

Instead, I created the outline of the “blog” portion of my website. It's not in the original design, but I want to have one, so I created the framework to create blog posts and jury rigged a way to display them. It's not pretty right now, but at least I can report on the progress I've made, even if it's not visible right now.

Signing off!
