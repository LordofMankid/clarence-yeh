I had a bit of a rest this weekend, but I decided to stop procrastinating and finally try animating the [Freebites website](https://www.freebites.org/) with [Pixi.js](https://pixijs.com/).

The section where the phone is at is supposed to be animated, and for that, we're using a combination of [anime.js](https://animejs.com) and Pixi.js. 

<SectionTitle title="What's that?" />

anime.js is an animation library that allows you toâ€¦animate things. So why use two animation libraries? It's because Pixi.js is for animating actual animations, like animating the phone itself, while anime.js will be used for animating interactable UI components, 


```ts
```
