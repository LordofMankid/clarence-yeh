I had a bit of a rest this weekend, but I decided to stop procrastinating and finally try animating the [Freebites website](https://www.freebites.org/) with [Pixi.js](https://pixijs.com/).

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dqjxcxacd/image/upload/v1754246424/da807e41-df3a-4ec1-a30f-3267cd659549.png)

The section where the phone is at is supposed to be animated, and for that, we're using a combination of [anime.js](https://animejs.com) and Pixi.js.

<SectionTitle title="What's that?" />

anime.js is an animation library that allows you toâ€¦animate things. So is Pixi. So why use two animation libraries? Pixi.js a WebGL renderer, used for animating *actual* animations, or even games, so I can animate sprites, filters, and entire scenes. This is ideal for complex animations that will be on the phone. On the other hand, anime.js will be used for animating interactable UI components directly in the DOM, like `<p>` or `<div>` tags. Most importantly, it syncs with user interactions, like scrolling:

```ts
  // animate on scroll
        animate(topHeroRef.current, {
          opacity: { from: 1, to: 0, duration: 350, ease: "in(3)" },
          autoplay: onScroll({
            target: topHeroRef.current,
            container: ".page",
            enter: "top+=10% top",
            leave: "top+=10% bottom-=20%",
            repeat: true,
            sync: 1,
            // debug: true,
          }),
        });

        animate(popupWrapperRef.current, {
          opacity: { from: 1, to: 0, duration: 350, ease: "in(3)" },
          translateY: {
            from: 0,
            to: 150,
            ease: "linear",
            duration: 1000,
          },
          autoplay: onScroll({
            target: topHeroRef.current,
            container: ".page",
            enter: "top+=10% top",
            leave: "top+=10% bottom+=20%",
            repeat: true,
            sync: 0.1,
            // debug: true,
          }),
        });
      }
```

I can trigger methods from these scroll observers to trigger animations in the Pixi.js canvas (aka the phone), like .call(handleAnimation);
