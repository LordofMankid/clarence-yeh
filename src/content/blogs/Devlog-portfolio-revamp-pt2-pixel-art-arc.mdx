## It's almost there!

Today, I focused on building up my project carousel. It took me a while to port over the correct types I needed and add them to my content collections (you can check out my [earlier blog post ](https://www.clarence-yeh.dev/blogs/Devlog-revamping-the-portfolio.mdx)about this). Below is my final product:![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dqjxcxacd/image/upload/v1757470079/c9e62870-fcad-4034-8acb-bbb90006c75f.png)

It took me a while (too long) to position the back cards correctly, but that's okay! Instead, I want to talk about my pixel art journey. Since the designs only show 3 projects at a time, and I want people to see that I have more than 3 projects under my belt, I wanted to create a quick progress bar.

## My first sprite

This is where my pixel art journey began. The pages in the back are like some asset from Sarah, but the little dots below are mine. (I know, so impressive, right?)

I decided to use [PixiEditor](https://pixieditor.net/) on Steam, and I whipped up a super quick sprite.

I wanted the shape to be like a super simple crystal, and the only thing I had in mind were those xp crystals from survivor.io (i swear i play better games)

Okay, that was in my head, now that it's in front of meâ€¦I don't see it anymore. Maybe one of those ammo indicators in other pixel games. Anyway, it was the first sprite I ever made, so it was cool to be able to put that into my website.
