<SectionTitle title="Pair Programming!" />

I've been working with my friend Owen on the [freebites website](https://www.freebites.org/), and today we did a pair programming session. I haven't pair programmed since college, so it was a nice change of pace for sure.

Pair programming is actually pretty fun. Because two people are there, you tend to catch eachother's bugs before they become too large of an issue. Having different ideas on tackling problems also helps prevent you from going down the old coding rabbit hole. I suggest it. It also keeps you grounded and helps you vocalize your thought processes better.

<SectionTitle title="what we worked on" />

We started freebites' content management flow today. We don't have the absolute designs out right now, but there's a lot of stuff we can do in the meantime. We definitely need to set up things like basic CRUD operations and their API routes, authentication guards and the like. 

<SectionTitle title="Question - Why don't you handle this all in-app?" />

A great question! We're trying to divide and conquer. We absolutely need a content moderation system for admins, and we do have a rudimentary one on the mobile app, but it's something that:

1. Helps out a few dedicated users that won't mind opening the web app for moderation
2. Is easy to separate from the main app
3. Can be iterated and shipped faster on the web than in the mobile release cycle.

This also frees our mobile developers to focus on features for all users instead of building complex admin tools for the 1-2 admins per school that will actually use it.
