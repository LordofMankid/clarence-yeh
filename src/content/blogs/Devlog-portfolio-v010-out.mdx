## v0.1.0

This is the big release! I was gonna call it v1.0.0 but it's genuinely just not done yet…the about section doesn't work, but I think it looks presentable right now, so I wanted to release it to motivate myself to keep working on the portfolio. Today, I cleaned up some logic with smooth scrolling and the page transitions. I also ported over the project/blog details, which has a more updated look now:

Above is my new version, versus the older one below:

Again, it's all still a work in progress. I felt that the normal font I was using, which is a monospaced [Anonymous Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Anonymous+Pro), was a little hard to read:

Well, it looks okay, but I wanted a font that was easier on the eyes, so I decided to try a out a different monospaced (for the computer terminal vibes) font called [IBM Plex Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Mono). I'm completely clueless about typography, so I don't know exactly what to say about it, but it seems focused less on the style and more on the readability in long blocks of text.

## So, what's next?

Now that it's mostly out of the way, I want to finish the “about” section, and then start thinking up a lot of little things to make this site a lot more “homey” and “alive". Some ideas I have:

- animated background, reactive to time of day (but that's more art so we'll see)
- music? or a little disc spinning connected to my spotify account
- a “featured” section for my blog posts directly on my landing page
- a “demo” section to demo projects directly on my site, like a video game i made with some friends

Bright future for my portfolio, and maybe for me! woooo
