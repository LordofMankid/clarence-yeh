## What's new?

I've just had my first week at in my first job at [Cambridge Mobile Telematics](https://www.cmtelematics.com/)! I've been kind of quiet when it comes to development on my side projects for the last few months because I've been really head-down on the grind during this application cycle. I was very fortunate to have landed a role at this company. It's a telematics company, so essentially the company does a lot of work with car sensors, etc., uses this information to calculate driving risks and works with insurers, and the public sector to help keep our roads safer.

Not sure how much more detail I can go into here, but I'll be working specifically on a newer product that CMT has been shipping Club. Mobile apps are pretty on-brand for the work I've been doing, so not much surprise there :).

## Freebites!

I did do work on Freebites during this time, which I may blog about later. I do intend to continue on with Freebites, but I will take much more of backseat role, and we have agreed as an organization to put the whole “startup” vibe of Freebites on the back-burner; there's no one around that's left who will put in the full-time effort expected in a startup. 

We've entered talks with different universities, and we will honor our commitments to those universities, but we won't place any more pressure to expand to more schools after that.

## What to expect?

I did start this portfolio site as a way to showcase my work for potential employers, but now I think I'll pivot this site more to building a “brand” and an online presence to better showcase who I am as a person. Expect more talk about side hobbies that are NOT code related. I might get back into YouTube videos, who knows?

Though I'll probably keep working on side coding projects, albeit more sporadically to avoid coding burnout. While officially I'm a full-stack developer, I've been (currently) assigned to do mostly backend development, so I gotta keep that front-end dev experience fresh.
