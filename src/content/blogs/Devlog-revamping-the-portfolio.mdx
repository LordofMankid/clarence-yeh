Today I got to work on my portfolio. Well, I started a few days ago, but I didn't actually get much done. I decided to use the Framer's `motion dev` package to get some animations in.

<SectionTitle title="anime.js vs motion" />

anime.js is lightweight and powerful, but I'm using a lot of React. anime.js uses vanilla JS, which can absolutely be used for React. But I'm using a lot of React, with some HTML in my .`astro` files. I think motion is just a bit simpler when I'm using React as there's more React based documentation.

<SectionTitle title="landing pages and project cards" />

my friend Sarah updated the designs a little bit and I did some cleanup on the landing page:

I was doing work with friends and thus not super engaged, so I just hacked together a super temporary solution that scaled the image up and down based on window size. I'm probably just doing something wrong, but I'll revisit this later.

I also started working on the new project card component. I want this to be more of a “fantasy” kind of vibe because that's what I'm into, so my project cards are going to be more like pieces of paper:

for easier access, i'll have a full list of my projects in a simple list below the cards, as each card is pretty big. i now need to change up the props and type up so i can hook them up again to TinaCMS, but I want to wait until I'm sure of the schema again before I do so again.
