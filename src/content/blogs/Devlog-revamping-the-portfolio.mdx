Today I got to work on my portfolio. Well, I started a few days ago, but I didn't actually get much done. I decided to use the Framer's `motion` package for react to get some animations and scroll stuff.

anime.js was great and all, but I think motion is just a bit simpler to work with as there's more React based documentation
