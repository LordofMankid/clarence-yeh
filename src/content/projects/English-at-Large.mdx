<h2> Overview </h2>

I recently finished making a full-stack library web app for English at Large, a nonprofit serving 25+ communities in the Greater Boston area that focuses on teaching immigrants English. As a child of immigrants, this is cause I believe strongly in and I'm happy to have done this as my capstone project through [Tufts Jumbocode](https://jumbocode.org/).

The project uses React/TypeScript, Prisma + Postgres, and Nextjs hosted on Vercel, and Clerk for authentication.

<h2> My Involvement </h2>

I was the Technical Lead, so I worked with my project manager Jennifer (she's great) to get a team together, and I was lucky to have one of(imo) the best teams \:D. Thank you to our designer, Fa, and our developers, Owen, Hannah, Gaby, Keiji, Ava, Javi, Jet, Natalie, Kabir, Sela, and Rakshi for their excellent work through the year.
