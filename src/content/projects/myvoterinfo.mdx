<SectionTitle title="OVERVIEW" />

Tufts JumboCode held its first hackathon in five years, and I worked together with
my friends Jessie, Lydia, and Yihui to compete. When we talked about problems that
we wanted to solve, with an election coming up, we realized that there is a significant
barrier to entry in many states across the United States, namely the issue of
voter registrations -- many people get deregistered without being aware. So
we created the MVP of an app that would tell you if you were ever deregistered.

<SectionTitle title="MY INVOLVEMENT" />

I created the authentication system through Firebase, as well as a screen on the
app where users can see relevant election information in their area, such as
polling places and their operation hours. I also created a way for users to report
waiting times to inform other users on the best polling places to go to.
