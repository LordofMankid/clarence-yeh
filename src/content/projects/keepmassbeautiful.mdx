<SectionTitle title="OVERVIEW" />

Keep Mass Beautiful (KMB) is a statewide organization with over 40+ chapters and thousands
of members dedicated to keeping Massachusetts clean. KMB tasked Tufts JumboCode
with coming up with a website builder to help all these different chapters boost
their Internet presence.

<SectionTitle title="MY INVOLVEMENT" />

I grew up in Massachusetts and I did Scouts for ten years, so it's a cause I'd like to fight
for. And at JumboCode, I got the chance to apply for and join this amazing team.

<br />

I helped to make a bunch of the UI elements, as well as backend functions,
like coding signup system. Shout out to Matt and Anneka for a being such a
great TL/PM pair. They inspired me to lead my own team at JumboCode.
