<SectionTitle title="OVERVIEW" />

This is a project I worked on with my friends Johnny, Won, Yihui, and Loc for development, with our cracked designer, Fa, who I've worked with on a different project for English at Large. They're all insanely cracked. As [previous hackathon winners](https://clarence-yeh.vercel.app/projects/myvoterinfo.mdx) (Yihui was on my team last year), we decided we'd proven ourselves already in the webdev space. We opted to really challenge ourselves on a technical level, focusing less on front-end and more on the backend space.

Our project was a virtual career fair experience where users could walk around to different booths and queue up for 1:1 calls with recruiters, as well as being able to walk around and network with other participants 1:1 in real time.

This meant we needed to build a a web app with proximity chat and real-time multiplayer simulation through WebSockets.
