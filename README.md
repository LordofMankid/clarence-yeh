# welcome to my website!

this is my portfolio site, something i've meant to do over the last two years, but i've been pushing off until now.

i'm hoping to be more consistent in updating this, but we'll see...

# outline

### stack
it's Astro.js/React.js/TypeScript. Hosted on Vercel.

i'm using Astro.js as the main framework to keep the site light, and React for interactive, client-side components.

### workflow
for the content on the website (blogs, etc), i'm using [TinaCMS](https://tina.io/). originally, i had my own solution but i'm not going to reinvent the wheel(i got lazy). what it does it provides me a visual Markdown editor so I'm not editing each page directly in the code, then i do some stuff with the actual markdown so that new projects are automatically added into the components using frontmatter, etc. 

images are hosted in Cloudinary, and i integrated it with Tina to be able to add images to my blogs
